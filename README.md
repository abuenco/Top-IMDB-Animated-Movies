# Top-IMDB-Animated-Movies

## About the Project

This project was done as a quick personal exercise in teaching myself SQL and using SQL in a Python environment. 
The dataset is [sourced from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tarundalal/animated-movies-imdb) and consists of the Top 85 Animated Movies on IMDB.
The script uses SQLite3 to work directly with the database. Pandas is used to extract data from the table, and Matplotlib is used for creating data
visualizations.
